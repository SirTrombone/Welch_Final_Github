  <p class="article">Police shootings over the last 13 years have shown an abnormally higher rate of black Oklahoma City citizens getting shot and killed. Information on officer-involved shootings over the last 13 years has shown that the police department violently involves itself with black people just as much, if not more than, white people, despite having a much smaller population in the city.</p>

<p class="article">The black Oklahoma City population over the last 15 years has typically been around a fourth of the white population, yet the amount of black citizens per 10,000 people that are involved in police shootings is much higher than the white population or that of any other race. 5.59 black peoples per 10,000 is disproportionately higher than the rate for white people, who averaged 1.29 peoples per 10,000.</p>

<p class="article">Tommy Addler, who has practiced as a criminal defense lawyer in Oklahoma City for 20 years, says this is likely due to “police presence [being] extremely heightened in impoverished communities which are disproportionately inhabited by people of color. Where you go fishing is where you’re going to catch the most fish.”</p>

<p class="article">While Addler believes that the problem of police surveillance and racial bias is nationwide, he believes that in the southern United States it can be more prevalent and common. The communication provided by the internet has allowed the public to question the police officer in ways it never could before, according to Addler.</p>

<p class="article">“With the advent of more technology being part of the standard police equipment, I think we are finally just starting to have tangible evidence to the fact that law enforcement is taking these encounters too far,” he said. “I think for generations these things have been seen as justified based on an officer's verbal assertion that someone was acting erratically or aggressively. In that instance you have a dead minority and a police officer whose version is the only version out there.”</p>

<p class="article">Police are able to monitor spaces that are predominantly populated by minorities rather casually. Yet the casualty of the encounter, Addler says, doesn’t dictate the officer’s purpose. “It’s the way that law enforcement interacts with minorities that I think is different,” he said. “Time and time again in the police reports that I see that start with innocuous traffic stops, that’s not what happens when you’re talking about police interaction with a minority group.”</p>

<p class="article">Harm for black Oklahoma City citizens from the police is also disproportionate compared to other racial groups over the last 13 years. Despite having a smaller population in the city than both White and Hispanic groups, black people are shown to be killed by police at a much higher rate, with 25 people per 100,000 dying to police. The stark difference between races can be tied to police over policing areas with high rates of racial minorities and economic inequality.
</p>

<p class="article">Addler says that officers go into poor parts of the city looking for trouble for a sense of fulfillment. “I believe it’s part of law enforcement culture that the more outrageous or frankly dangerous types of interactions of investigations a law enforcement officer is having with a community the more fulfilling on some level that is to law enforcement,” he said. “I have friends who I’ve known both before and since they’ve become law enforcement officers and I’ve seen a change in their attitudes towards people, attitudes towards minority groups. They’ve expressed to me that it’s boring for them to work and have nothing of significance happen. I think law enforcement culture is unhealthy in that it almost goes looking for trouble.” 
</p>

<p class="article">Police use an area’s crime level to adjust their level of care, involvement, and level of enforcement. High crime areas can be used, Addler says, to justify probable cause for an officer. Stigma of a certain location affects an officer's behavior, he believes. So seeing such a disparity in the officer-involved shooting statistics shows that that same stigma can be affecting the cop’s actions and aggression during their surveillance of crime-expected areas. Addler says that cops like to monitor high crime areas because it gives them the most action and freedom to operate. High crime areas “justify” certain actions that other place’s don’t. With those places being disproportionately populated with racial minorities, they face the brunt of that force. </p>
 
<p class="article">“If you go looking for trouble in impoverished communities and you can use the fact that you’re in a high crime area to justify what you’re doing, it’s going to automatically generate more law enforcement interactions with civilians and from there it’s going to generate more arrests, and potentially more violence,” Addler said.</p>
